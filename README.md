# keylock
yes i made this because i wanted a password manager on my own homeserver and i wanted to deploy it on my own server

## explanations
im using go because it cross compiles EVERYWHEREEE (and i love go)

## features i plan to implement
- otp
- password generation
- password strength checking
- other clients besides cli (web, mobile, etc)
- swap sqlite driver for non-cgo driver
- move database types outside of database package

note make command for setup
